    <h3>Introduction and Learning Outcomes</h3>

    <p>Welcome to Corporate Finance. The goal of this course is to acquaint you with the fundamental principles of corporate finance. We begin with the basics of the time value of money in perfect market settings, and then we relax some of these assumptions and understand how to work with time-varying rates of returns and uncertain cash flows, including default risk.  We then explore asset pricing models, especially the CAPM, understand the difference between financial statements and economic cash flows, and finally study how all of these topics are applied in the context of Delaware appraisal cases.  The last third of the class explores in detail various securities issued by firms, such as debt and preferred stock, and focuses on how firms can add value by adjusting their capital structure, incluing by issuing or buying back their shares.  If time permits, we will cover financial derivatives such as option contracts.  </p>
    
    <p>The course covers roughly many of the same topics as a typical corporate finance class in an MBA program, but we focus on legal applications of corporate finance principles.  We consequently omit certain topics, such as the nuances of investment theory and capital budgeting applications, which, in particular, are of more interest to managers rather than attorneys.    </p> 
    
    <p> A fair question is why I adopted this approach, which is decidedly more quantitative than a typical law school class and will require you to develop and hone more quantitative skills than you will probably use during the first year of your first legal job. A couple of responses. First, if you work hard, this class will give you a solid grounding in the basic principles of corporate finance. This will enable you to understand better the transactions you will work on, your clients' goals, and help you to communicate better with them. Second, when you begin work, you will not have the time or energy to learn corporate finance on your own. You will also observe that law firm partners generally understand very well these principles, at least on an intuitive level. Third, the skills you acquire in this class will give you a leg up on the competition. And finally, knowledge of finance is portable to other endeavors and is a necessary prerequisite to landing a job with a hedge fund, private equity fund, or bank, as have many alumni of this class. </p>
    
    <p>The knowledge gained in this class is extremely valuable in related corporate classes, such as M&A, corporate reorganizations, securities regulation, introduction to the deal, venture capital, and private equity.  If you have not taken a basic financial accounting course, I highly recommend that you try to take one before graduation, preferably next door in the business school--the course is 2 credits and is graded on a pass/fail basis. Like finance, accounting is part of the basic grammar of business discourse, and a little knowledge goes a long way.  Here are some comments by former students on the class, a sample syllabus, and a list of other business school courses that you can take for credit.  Here are some online accounting courses; the one at Wharton is especially good.</p>
