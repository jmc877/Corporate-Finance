        <strong>Class Practice Problems</strong>  
    </div>
    <br>

    <h3>Class Practice Problem Guidelines</h3>
        <p> During the semester, I will distribute practice problems to reinforce your knowledge of the materials covered. You should attempt to answer all of the problems.  Many of problems are best done using Excel, and I highly encourage you to improve your <textit>basic</textit> Excel skills, especially if you haven't worked with it much before.  Note, your grade will not depend on your Excel skills, but it's a useful business skill to develop.  I'm happy to distribute some suggestions of how I set up some of the problems in Excel.  
        </p> 
          <br>
        <p>Since we will not cover all of the problems, I will let you know beforehand which ones we will focus on in class.  Some of the problems simply will ask for a formula, e.g., the present value of an annuity.  We won't devote any class time to those.  The more detailed ones will require you to apply concepts or formulas that we've covered to some real world facts.   </p>
          <br>
        <p> I encourage you to experiment with LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, in answering the problems.  It is important to explore the benefits and limitations of LLMs.  You'll see that many of the numerical answers given by LLMs to the problems are incorrect.  C'est la vie.</p>
     
        </p>  
           <!--  <li>I strongly urge you to work in groups of up to 3 or 4 persons. If you work with other people, please submit only 1 homework.      
            </li>
            <li>You can upload (drag-and-drop) the homeworks here:  <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/request/44KrtnRzSEBh8ZxgTTx5">Homework Dropbox Link</a>.   
            </li> 
           <li>In the box for your name, please enter the HW number, e.g., HW1; in the box for your email address, just enter the HW # and use gmail.com, e.g., HW1@gmail.com.</li> 
            <li>I encourage you to experiment with LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT, in answering the problems.  It is important to explore the benefits and limitations of LLMs.  You'll see that many of the answers given by LLMs to the HW problems are incorrect.</li>
            <li>Don't use your name or otherwise identify yourself on the HWs or in the file name.
            </li>
            <li>The homeworks must be typed, but may be done in either Excel or Word (or any similar program), unless otherwise specified.
            </li>
            <li>If you submit them electronically:
              <ul>
                <li>You can submit it as a Word, Excel, or PDF file, unless I ask to submit the HW as an Excel file.</li>
                <li>If you do the HW in Excel, please turn off gridlines.</li>
                <li>Please name the file as follows: Homework X Id XX, with the appropriate homework number and homework id number(s).</li>
                <li>Please make sure that it is properly formatted so that all pages print out on standard letter-sized paper.</li>
              </ul> 
            <li>On each page of the homework, please insert a header with the relevant homework number, your homework id (or ids), and the page number e.g., HW: 1, ID: 123, page 1 of 4.  This helps me identify any missing pages.</li>
            <li>Please do not used colored fonts or insert any text in a cell that has a colored background. </li>
            <li>At the beginning of the semester, each student will be assigned a unique homework number.  Please only use this number when turning in your homework assignments.</li> 
            <li>The due date for each homework will be announced when it is posted, and you will generally have 1 week to complete it. Late homeworks will not be graded.     </li> 
           
            <li>In computing your final homework grade, I will drop the lowest score.     </li>
                   
            <li>The homeworks will account for roughly 15% of your grade.     </li>
