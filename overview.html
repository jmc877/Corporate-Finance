    <h3>Introduction and Learning Outcomes</h3>
    <p>Welcome to Corporate Finance. The goal of this course is to acquaint you
        with the fundamental principles of corporate finance. We begin with the basics of the time value of money in perfect market settings, and then we relax some of these assumptions and understand how to work with time-varying rates of returns and uncertain cash flows, including default risk. We then explore asset pricing models, especially the CAPM, understand the difference between financial statements and economic cash flows, and finally study how all of these topics are applied in the context of Delaware appraisal cases. The last third of the class explores in detail various securities issued by firms, such as debt and preferred stock, and we focus on how firms can add value by adjusting their capital structure. If time permits, we will cover financial derivatives, including options.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>The course covers roughly many of the same topics as a typical corporate finance
        class in an MBA program, but we try to focus on legal applications of corporate finance principles. We consequently omit certain topics, such as the nuances of investment theory and capital budgeting applications, which are of more interest to managers than to attorneys.
    </p>
     <br>       
    <p>A fair question is why I adopted this approach, which is decidedly more 
        quantitative than a typical law school class and will require you to develop and hone more quantitative skills than you will probably use during the first year of your first legal job.  A couple of responses.  First, if you work hard,
        this class will give you a solid grounding in the basic principles of corporate finance. This will enable you to understand better the transactions you will
        work on, your clients' goals, and help you to communicate better with them. Second, when you begin work, you will not have the time or energy to learn corporate finance on your own. You will also observe that law firm partners generally understand very well these principles, at least on an intuitive level.
        Third, the skills you acquire in this class will give you a leg up on the competition.  And finally, knowledge of finance is portable to other endeavors and is a necessary
        prerequisite to landing a job with a hedge fund, private equity fund, or bank, as have many alumni of this class.
    </p>
    <br>
     <p>The knowledge gained in this class is extremely valuable in related corporate law classes, such as M&A, corporate reorganizations, securities regulation, introduction to the deal, venture capital, and private equity. 
    </p> 
    <br>  
      <p>If you have not taken a basic financial accounting course, I highly recommend that you try to take one somewhere somehow before graduation. One option is next door in the business school--the course is 2 credits and is graded on a pass/fail basis. Like finance, accounting is part of the basic grammar of business discourse, and a little knowledge goes a long way. <a href="Accounting_BSchool.docx">Here are some comments</a> by former students on the class and a list of other business school courses that you can take for credit. Here is a good online Wharton course: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-accounting#syllabus">Wharton Accounting</a>. There are also free accounting courses on LinkedIn Learning, which you can access through my.fordham.edu.  These look decent:  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/financial-accounting-part-1/the-importance-of-accounting?u=80268241">

    <h3>Class Textbook </h3>

        <p>The book we will use this semester is <em>Corporate Finance </em> (5th ed. 2022) by Ivo Welch.  The book will be available for purchase at Amazon in August.  An overview and link to the free, online version is <a href="https://corpfin.ivo-welch.info/home/">here</a>. It is not available at the book store.  I very highly recommend that you order the very reasonably priced print edition.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>In past classes, I have used one of the standard MBA corporate finance texts, such as Brealey, Myers, and Allen, <em>Principles of Corporate Finance</em> [BMA], and Ross, Westerfield, and Jaffe, <em>Corporate Finance</em> [RWJ]. I adopted CF because I find that the writing style is fresher, the explanations clearer, and the examples more concrete. These characteristics help you to learn and retain the material. If you don't like Welch, feel free to use any edition of BMA or RWJ, along with the accompanying student study guides.  As you can see <a href="http://book.ivo-welch.info/bookcomparison.html">here</a>, all of the standard corporate finance texts cover the same materials.  
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> You can also find online an unlimited amount of materials--slides,
          notes, practice problems, etc.--on corporate finance. NYU's Prof. Damodaran's <a href="http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/" >Corporate Finance MBA class</a> (click on Teaching / MBA) at NYU is excellent.
        </p>
  
      <h3>Homework</h3>
   
        <p>You cannot learn the material without practice. You should try to do as many of the problems in the book as you can. Free free to skip those that involve a lot of algebra. I will also assign homeworks (based on prior classes, between 7-10) that will be graded. The homeworks must be typed.You will be assigned numbers so that the homeworks will be graded anonymously. You can work in groups of up to 3. If you work with other
        people, please submit only 1 homework. The due date for each homework will be announced when it is posted, and you will generally have 1 week to complete it. Late homeworks will not be graded. In computing your homework grade, I will drop the lowest score. The homeworks will account for roughly 15% of your grade.
        </p>

    <h3>Spreadsheet</h3>
    
        <p>To do almost all of the homework and in class problems, you will
        need to use a spreadsheet program, such as MS Excel, the world's most popular program.  All students have free access to Excel through Fordham. Basic knowledge of Excel is a fundamental business skill, even for lawyers. I've posted some Excel materials on the <em>Additional Resources</em> page.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> In the past, we used a financial calculator, such as the famous HP 12C, but calculators seem now to have be a mere relic.  It's probably best to improve your Excel skills. For the final exam, you may use either a calculator or spreadsheet program on your computer.
        </p>

    <h3>Laptops</h3>

      <p>I allow you to use laptops in the classroom, but that doesn't mean you should use them if you are concerned with doing well: <a href="https://goo.gl/XZxnuP">Laptops</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/corpfin20/NoteTaking_Computer_Summary.pdf? ">Laptops2</a>. I suggest that you print out the powerpoint slides and annotate them with your handwritten notes.
      </p>
    <h3>Attendance</h3>
        <p>Attendance is important. An unreasonable number of absences may result in a lower grade.
        </p>

    <h3>Recording</h3>
      <p>For the classes that are recorded this semester, the recordings are the property of the instructor, and students may not download or capture the recordings in any manner, share the recordings, or use them for non-class purposes.
