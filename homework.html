    <h3>Homework Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I strongly urge you to work in groups of up to 3 or 4 persons. If you work with other people, please submit only 1 homework.      
            </li>
            <li>You can upload (drag-and-drop) the homeworks here:  <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/request/44KrtnRzSEBh8ZxgTTx5">Homework Dropbox Link</a>.   
            </li> 
           <li>In the box for your name, please enter the HW number, e.g., HW1; in the box for your email address, just enter the HW # and use gmail.com, e.g., HW1@gmail.com.</li> 
            <li>I encourage you to experiment with LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT, in answering the problems.  It is important to explore the benefits and limitations of LLMs.  You'll see that many of the answers given by LLMs to the HW problems are incorrect.</li>
            <li>Don't use your name or otherwise identify yourself on the HWs or in the file name.
            </li>
            <li>The homeworks must be typed, but may be done in either Excel or Word (or any similar program), unless otherwise specified.
            </li>
            <li>If you submit them electronically:
              <ul>
                <li>You can submit it as a Word, Excel, or PDF file, unless I ask to submit the HW as an Excel file.</li>
                <li>If you do the HW in Excel, please turn off gridlines.</li>
                <li>Please name the file as follows: Homework X Id XX, with the appropriate homework number and homework id number(s).</li>
                <li>Please make sure that it is properly formatted so that all pages print out on standard letter-sized paper.</li>
              </ul> 
            <li>On each page of the homework, please insert a header with the relevant homework number, your homework id (or ids), and the page number e.g., HW: 1, ID: 123, page 1 of 4.  This helps me identify any missing pages.</li>
            <li>Please do not used colored fonts or insert any text in a cell that has a colored background. </li>
            <li>At the beginning of the semester, each student will be assigned a unique homework number.  Please only use this number when turning in your homework assignments.</li> 
            <li>The due date for each homework will be announced when it is posted, and you will generally have 1 week to complete it. Late homeworks will not be graded.     </li> 
           
            <li>In computing your final homework grade, I will drop the lowest score.     </li>
                   
            <li>The homeworks will account for roughly 15% of your grade.     </li>
       
        </ul>
