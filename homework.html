    <h3>Homework Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You can upload the homeworks here:  <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/request/44KrtnRzSEBh8ZxgTTx5">Homework Dropbox Link</a>.  In the box for your first name, please enter the HW number, e.g., HW1; in the box for your last name, please enter your HW Ids, e.g., 12, 14, 16.  You'll have to enter a email account, but just enter the HW # and use gmail.com, e.g., HW1@gmail.com.
            </li> 
            <li>Don't use your name or otherwise identify yourself on the HWs or in the file name.
            </li>
            <li>The homeworks must be typed, but may be done in either Excel or Word (or any similar program), unless otherwise specified.
            </li>
            <li>If you submit them electronically:
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>You can submit it as a Word, Excel, or PDF file, unless I ask to submit the HW as an excel file.
                </li>
                <li>If you did the HW in Excel, please turn off gridlines before converting the file to pdf.
                </li>
                <li>Please name the file as follows: Homework X, Id. XX, with the appropriate homework number and homework id number(s).</li>
                <li>Please make sure that it is properly formatted so that all pages print out on standard letter-sized paper.</li>
            </ul> 
            <li>On each page of the homework, please insert a Header with your homework id (or ids), the relevant homework, and the page number e.g., ID: 123, HW 1, page 1 of 4.
            </li>
            <li>Please do not used colored fonts or insert any text in a cell that has a colored background.
            </li>
            <li>At the beginning of the semester, each student will be assigned a unique homework number.  Please only use this number when turning in your homework assignments and do not put your name or your exam id on the homework.
            </li>
            <li>I strongly urge you to work in groups of up to 3 or 4 persons. If you work with other people, please submit only 1 homework.      
            </li>
            <li>The due date for each homework will be announced when it is posted, and you will generally have 1 week to complete it. Late homeworks will not be graded.     
            </li>
            <li>In computing your final homework grade, I will drop the lowest score.
            </li>
            <li>The homeworks will account for roughly 15% of your grade
            </li>
        </ul>
